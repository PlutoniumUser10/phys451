\kafkasubsection{Near critical points, the self-similarity under rescaling leads to characteristic power-law singularities. These dependences may be disguised, however, by less-singular corrections to scaling. An experiment measures the
susceptibility $\chi(T)$ in a magnet for temperatures T slightly above the ferromagnetic transition temperature Tc. They find their data is fit well by the form
\begin{equation}
    \chi(T) = A(T-T_c)^{-1.25}+ B + C(T-T_c) + D(T-T_c)^{1.77}
\end{equation}
Assuming this is the correct dependence near Tc, what is the critical exponent $\gamma$

\kafkasubsection{
The pair correlation function $C(r,T) = \braket{\sigma_i\sigma_{i+r}}$ is measured in another,
three-dimensional system just above $T_c$. It is found to be spherically symmetric, and of the form
\begin{equation}
    C(r,T) = r^{-1.026} G(r(T-T_c)^{0.59})
\end{equation}
Where the function $G(x)$ is found to be roughly $exp(-x)$. What is the critical exponent $\nu$?
