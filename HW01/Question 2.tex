\kafkasubsection{To understand the meaning of the various solutions of (5.108), expand the free energy in
(5.126) about $m = 0$ with $H = 0$ and show that the form of $f(m)$ near the critical point (small m) is given by
\begin{equation}
    f(m) = a + b(1-\beta qJ)m^2 + cm^4
\end{equation}
Determine $a, b, $ and $c$
